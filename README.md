# Real-Estate-Website

ï»¿

Dive into my Real Estate Website project, a testament to my HTML and CSS skills. With multiple web pages showcasing various properties, users can easily navigate through listings and access detailed information by clicking on the 'Know More' section. This basic yet functional design incorporates responsive layouts and image galleries to provide an immersive browsing experience. Witness how simple coding techniques can transform static web pages into dynamic property showcases, demonstrating my ability to create user-friendly interfaces with essential features.
